## 📓 Notes & Wins
- **Highlight of the Day:** I believe I see the right path. Problem: Dogs that are stray are screwed. Shelters are overrun and the only option is run the streets are be killed. Honestly, I feel like running the streets is better for them but I do not know if they are lonely or happy to be alive and free? But there is a 3rd option. We get involved. 
- Start the dog food business and that drives the shelter. not just a little bit of money goes to the shelter. I mean they are tied together. You can show people we can feed dogs real food that is affordable. Get donations from the markets or ranches or where ever there is food that is left over. 
- Maybe make it a private club so the govt doesn't fuck things up? 
- 
- **Setback (If Any) & Lesson:**  Low Vibration behavior set me back a week. Not a couple days like I thought might be the case, a full week. you can do the low vibration stuff, but is it worth it? Remember the anxiety that lasted for days. and the fear of being stuck forever in that anxiety hell. It screws up your ability to think clearly and you become incredibly fearful. Remember that when you think of doing low vibration things. Feel those negative emotions and then ask if it is worth it.
- 
- **Gratitude:** thank you for this incredible opportunity, to live life and be so blessed. The hardest part is behind me! For that I am incredibly grateful. I am incredibly grateful for the realization that the hardest part is behind me!!
