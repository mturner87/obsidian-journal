## 🧠 Energy & Mental Clarity
- **Sleep Quality (1–10):**  7
- **Morning Energy (1–10):**  7
- **Focus During Work/Study:**  Good, better even, had a major crash for about 2 hours around 2-4 pm. Really struggled. But then it got a lot better. Definitely still on the uptrend it feels like.
- **Did I Fall Asleep Unintentionally?:**  Yes twice in the 2-4 time frame and during morning meditation
- **Brain Fog Moments / Triggers:** lots of brain fog leading up to it.

- **Stable at This Level? (Y/N):**  y
- *(Compare to yesterday’s log: 2025-06-30)* better but the Dr visit was today and they dose me at 60, i have my take homes until Friday the 11th so I will drop back down to 50

## 🧘 Spiritual Work

- **Completed:**  50%
- **Distractions / Triggers:**  none really
- **Improvement Notes:** get better at focusing on daily goals. Kevin O'Leary was saying steve jobs would say "focus on the 3-5 things you have to do today and do not let anything stop you from accomplishing these things" ignore the rest or anything that stops you from focusing and finishing those 3-5 things. these 3-5 things are the "signal"
- so moving fwd I need to focus on the signal

- **Gratitude:** I am so grateful for the realization that the hardest is behind me and I can build and I create my life!! My kids and my dad and the relationships i have with them. I am so blessed. I am blessed to live in this crazy time. What a time to be alive.
